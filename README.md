# Preface

[**Raspberry Pi Full Stack**](https://longervision.gitbooks.io/raspberry-pi-full-stack/) is an open source book entirely written by [NanJing Longer Vision Robot Technology Ltd.](http://www.longervisionrobot.com). In this book, over 20 examples are to be discussed for the Raspberry Pi applications. You will get familiar with:

* Basic concepts on what Raspberry Pi is
* How to install the operating system **Raspbian** onto an Raspberry Pi
* How to use GPIO on Raspberry Pi by around 20 examples
* Pi CAM
* And our target of this book is to finally build a Raspberry Pi based race car, namely, an Mini-size Autonomous Vehicle with selected sensors.

The book is put on gitbook at: [https://longervision.gitbooks.io/raspberry-pi-full-stack/](https://longervision.gitbooks.io/raspberry-pi-full-stack/), and all source code is tested and put on github at: [https://github.com/LongerVision/RaspberryPi](https://github.com/LongerVision/RaspberryPi) .
